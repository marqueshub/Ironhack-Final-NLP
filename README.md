Project_Description

I would like to analyse a Data set of Amazon reviews from 2018, considering only the Home and Kitchen products category.
The goal to extract people's opinions from the review texts, and classify them into sentiment classes in order to obtain insights about products popularity and people's sentiments about them. 

Datasets 

I intend to use two databanks for my analysis. One of them contains the texts and the review scores and the other one contains features I might need for further analysis.
